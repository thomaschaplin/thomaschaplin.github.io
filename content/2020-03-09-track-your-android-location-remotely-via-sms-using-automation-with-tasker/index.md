Now click on the ‚úîÔ∏èbutton next to the magnifying glass to save the changes. Once you‚Äôve done that, click on the ellipsis (‚Ä¶) button in the top right and click on **Enable Tasker**.

## Done

You have now successfully built the automation to handle the SMS trigger which will send the location of the device.

# Test the automation

- Open your SMS app.
- Send yourself a text message with the trigger message you chose i.e. #TRIGGER
- You should receive a text from yourself with the trigger message.
- You should then receive a text with a Google Maps link of the location of your device.

You will now be able to send your device a SMS with the trigger message from any mobile phone.

_Remember not to share the trigger word with anyone, otherwise they will be able to track you too!_

# Conclusion

In this blog post, we covered how to build automation that when a SMS message is received with a trigger word, it automatically replies with the location of the device. This can be used for tracking your mobile phone if you‚Äôve lost it or someone has stolen it.

This was just one example of what you can automate with Tasker for Android. The possibilities are endless. Go and automate something!
